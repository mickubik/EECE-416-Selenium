Login story

Narrative:
In order to allow users access to the web application Toggl
As a test development team
I want to use Behaviour-Driven Development
					 
Scenario:  Logging into the web application
Given the https://new.toggl.com/ website is open
When the user clicks login
And enters the correct username and password
Then toggl logs them in and opens the Timer page
